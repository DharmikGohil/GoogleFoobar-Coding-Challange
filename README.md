# GoogleFoobar-Coding-Challange


Google Foobar is a mysterious and invite-only coding challenge platform created by Google. It is designed to discover and recruit talented developers for potential job opportunities at Google. If you receive an invitation to participate in Google Foobar, it means that Google has identified your coding skills and believes you have the potential to tackle complex algorithmic problems.

Foobar presents a series of coding challenges of increasing difficulty, covering various computer science concepts and problem-solving skills. The challenges are not only an opportunity to showcase your coding prowess but also a chance to learn and enhance your skills in a fun and engaging way.

Here in this repository you can find all coding questions and answer written by me.

You can read all the problem statement Level wise in my repository with complete solution :)

And thanks GOOGLE for this exciting opportunity xd

### Here are all five level of coding challange that I have done in Google Foobar Challange ðŸ˜Š


### Level 1:
* [The cake is not a lie!](https://github.com/DharmikGohil/GoogleFoobar-Coding-Challange/tree/main/Level%201)

### Level 2:
* [Power Hungry](https://github.com/DharmikGohil/GoogleFoobar-Coding-Challange/tree/main/Level%202/First%20Problem)
* [Ion flux relabeling](https://github.com/DharmikGohil/GoogleFoobar-Coding-Challange/tree/main/Level%202/Second%20Problem)

### Level 3:
* [Bomb_Baby](https://github.com/DharmikGohil/GoogleFoobar-Coding-Challange/tree/main/Level%203/First%20Problem)
* [Prepare the Bunnies' Escape](https://github.com/DharmikGohil/GoogleFoobar-Coding-Challange/tree/main/Level%203/Second%20Problem)
* [Free the Bunny Workers](https://github.com/DharmikGohil/GoogleFoobar-Coding-Challange/tree/main/Level%203/Third%20Problem)

### Extra Problem that I have solved after level 5:
* [Expanding Nebula](https://github.com/DharmikGohil/GoogleFoobar-Coding-Challange/tree/main/Extra%20Problem)


You also get a encrypted message in tag:
### To Decrypt your message use this code
```
import base64

MESSAGE = ''' your encrypted message ''' #your encrypted message

KEY = 'your username' #I think your username is your mail address first text before @
                      # like if mail if abc23@gmail.com -> so username : abc23

result = []
for i, c in enumerate(base64.b64decode(MESSAGE)):
    result.append(chr(c ^ ord(KEY[i % len(KEY)])))

print(''.join(result))
```

This encrypted message not much important but it just appreciation to you for sovling problem!<br/>

In my case my decrypted message is :
`{'success' : 'great', 'colleague' : 'esteemed', 'efforts' : 'incredible', 'achievement' : 'unlocked', 'rabbits' : 'safe', 'foo' : 'win!'}`
